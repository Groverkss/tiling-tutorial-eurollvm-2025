# TinyTile: A TileAndFuse Tutorial

This repository contains code accompanied along with the tutorial ["An Introduction to Tensor Tiling in MLIR" given at EuroLLVM 2025](https://youtu.be/FLEb30WyroA?si=BBXuJofubQ_WpMIU).

This repository was confirmed to work along with the tutorial, but may not be up to date. The core idea however, is same.
